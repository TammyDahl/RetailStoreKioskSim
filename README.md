# Clothing Store Point of Sale System  
*Collaborative Project | SDSU CS 250 – Intro to Software Systems*

## Overview

This group project involved designing and documenting a point-of-sale (POS) system for a multi-location clothing store, along with building a working kiosk simulation to model its behavior. As a team, we developed a complete software design specification including UML class diagrams, a software architecture diagram, an entity relationship diagram (ERD), a full data dictionary, and detailed unit/integration/system test plans. I contributed to both the design and implementation phases, with a focus on defining the data structures, user roles, and transaction logic.

The corresponding kiosk simulation, built in Java, models real-world retail interactions such as login, inventory lookup, item scanning, and return processing. This project showcases my ability to work collaboratively on system design, think through business logic, and model structured, transactional workflows—key skills in data systems design, product analytics, and retail data infrastructure.

## Key Contributions

- Defined user roles and data access through class diagrams and permission logic  
- Modeled transaction workflows, return processing, and payment types using ERDs and object relationships  
- Developed a data dictionary with typed schema for all entities (Inventory, Sales, Users, Transactions)  
- Contributed to decision-making around database design (SQL vs. NoSQL) with rationale and trade-off documentation  
- Wrote and reviewed test plans for unit, integration, and system-level functionality  

## Project Highlights

### Features

- Role-based access (Admin vs. Employee)  
- Cloud-synced inventory and transaction databases  
- Real-time barcode scanning, payment processing, and receipt printing  
- Admin tools for reporting and data management  
- Frontend/backend separation with development roadmap and timeline  

### Architecture

- Software & UML class diagrams illustrating system structure and object relationships  
- ERD with normalized entities and primary/foreign key references  
- Data dictionary describing each table, field, and data type  

### Test Plan

- Unit tests for permission checks and inventory functions  
- Integration tests for method and database interactions  
- System tests for role access and UI logic across login, search, and transaction flow

## Why It’s in My Portfolio

As a future data analyst, I see value in understanding the systems that generate and manage data. This project gave me hands-on experience with:

- Modeling real-world workflows and translating them into structured data systems  
- Creating logical database designs with clear entity relationships and data validation  
- Collaborating cross-functionally to document, test, and refine a software product  

It also reflects my comfort with software documentation, technical writing, and thinking through product design from both a business and engineering perspective.
