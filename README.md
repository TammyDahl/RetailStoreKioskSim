# Clothing Store Point of Sale System  
*Software Design Project | SDSU CS 250 – Intro to Software Systems*

## Overview

This project was developed as part of a group assignment for CS 250: Intro to Software Systems at San Diego State University. Our goal was to design a functional and scalable **Point of Sale (POS) system** for a multi-location clothing retailer. The system supports daily retail operations—such as inventory tracking, transaction processing, user management, and data synchronization across store locations—while offering separate interfaces for employees and admins.

While this project focuses on software architecture, it reflects my broader interest in how structured systems manage and surface data. I’ve included it in my portfolio because it demonstrates my ability to work collaboratively on technical design, model real-world business operations, and think through the data structures that power applications.

## Key Contributions

- Defined user roles and data access through class diagrams and permission logic  
- Modeled transaction workflows, return processing, and payment types using ERDs and object relationships  
- Developed a data dictionary with typed schema for all entities (Inventory, Sales, Users, Transactions)  
- Contributed to decision-making around database design (SQL vs. NoSQL) with rationale and trade-off documentation  
- Wrote and reviewed test plans for unit, integration, and system-level functionality  

## Project Highlights

### Features

- Role-based access (Admin vs. Employee)  
- Cloud-synced inventory and transaction databases  
- Real-time barcode scanning, payment processing, and receipt printing  
- Admin tools for reporting and data management  
- Frontend/backend separation with development roadmap and timeline  

### Architecture

- Software & UML class diagrams illustrating system structure and object relationships  
- ERD with normalized entities and primary/foreign key references  
- Data dictionary describing each table, field, and data type  

### Test Plan

- Unit tests for permission checks and inventory functions  
- Integration tests for method and database interactions  
- System tests for role access and UI logic across login, search, and transaction flow

## Why It’s in My Portfolio

As a future data analyst, I see value in understanding the systems that generate and manage data. This project gave me hands-on experience with:

- Modeling real-world workflows and translating them into structured data systems  
- Creating logical database designs with clear entity relationships and data validation  
- Collaborating cross-functionally to document, test, and refine a software product  

It also reflects my comfort with software documentation, technical writing, and thinking through product design from both a business and engineering perspective.
